    <h3>Learning Scenario:</h3>
      <p>After 11 years of teaching math, I wanted to learn a new skill. I decided to enroll in a software development boot camp to learn how to code. The course was an 18 weeks long and covered Frontend technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js and other technologies. For 14 out of the 18 weeks, we had a coding assignment or project to complete that would cover what was learned during that week. </p>
      <p></p>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>The summative assessment for my 18-week frontend development course required me to create a website using react.js and react-bootstrap with react-router and an API feature, and three pages. I decided to build a weather app that integrated three different APIs - one for geolocation, one for directions on a map, and the third for weather. The project was challenging and pushed me beyond what I had previously made in the course. I was able to showcase my understanding of the material covered throughout the 18 weeks.</p>

    <h3>Connection to Learning Strategy:</h3>
      <p>The assessment I completed is grounded in project-based learning (PBL) theory. PBL is an instructional approach where students work on a project that is complex and realistic, which helps them develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills. The assessment required me to use various APIs and integrate them into a comprehensive and functional website, aligning with PBL's focus on authentic, real-world scenarios. According to Krajcik et al. (2014), PBL is an effective approach in STEM education as it engages students in the process of solving real-world problems, which leads to a better connection to the material covered and deeper understanding.</p>

      <p>The weather app project I created reflects a real-world problem that people encounter daily, which makes it authentic. This assessment required me to create something that solves a problem, an essential component of PBL (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). According to Blumenfeld et al. (1991), PBL helps students develop skills such as teamwork, communication, and critical thinking that are required to solve real-world problems. My weather app project is a practical demonstration of how PBL can be used in education to enhance students' learning experiences.</p>
