In the LDT300x project, you are being asked to design an online learning experience. You will identify a ‘learning gap’ or instructional need and then identify or create specific digital media to support content knowledge development to overcome the gap (you are not creating the entire lesson, only the objects that will be associated with it).

Signature Assignment

Part I: Statement of Learning Goal & Developing Digital Media 

Apply the theories, strategies, and skills learned during this course to design and create digital content for a specific learning experience. This project will combine elements from the 100x Learning Theories course and 200x Instructional Design Models course, so feel free to go back and review those courses to refresh your memory of the content. In this project, you are asked to design an online learning experience. You will identify the 'learning gap' or instructional need and then identify or create specific digital media to support content knowledge development to overcome the gap. Your Signature Assignment will include:

1 | Learning Gap

Statement of the learning gap (instructional need) that your content will help overcome. You should have one identified learning gap (instructional need) that covers all digital media you edit or create.  

2 | Instructional Strategy

Description of an instructional strategy on how the content can be infused into a learning experience.

3 | Development of the following digital content

The following is the minimum requirement for digital content. You may use the items created in this course—the weeks as listed in parentheses.
Digital document (ebook, flyer, infographic, interactive text, pdf). (Week 2 or 3)
Original digital video (2-4 minutes in length) published online with closed captioning (non-auto generated). (Week 4)
Screencast, mash-up, or other Creative Commons licensed work you edited/enhanced to create original work. (Week 5)
Enhanced Digital Images (at least two images) that you have created or edited in some manner. Identify how you've enhanced the images. (Week 3)
Interactive (adaptive type) module. (Week 7)
4 | OERs, Creative Commons, Checklists

Identify at least two Open Educational Resources to support content development.

Label your media with a Creative Commons license  (student choice on the level of rights to allow),

Apply your updated Digital Media Checklist created in week 1 to each digital media, provide the overview of findings, and describe in a short statement or rationale why each digital media artifact will support content development or your lesson.

Part II: Update Portfolio

Throughout this course, you have been updating your portfolio. Ensure it is up to date (including your Instructional Design Document) with your newly designed digital content from this course, along with your Digital Media Checklists review and rationale for how it supports content development. You have autonomy in how you present your portfolio design. For example, you can create a separate page for your content developed each week, create multiple pages, or have a new site; that is up to you. However, your Signature Assignment content must be published and available online on one page of your portfolio for your 300x Signature Assignment to be considered submitted. Your IDD should not be used to present your Signature Assignment.
