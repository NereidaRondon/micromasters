    <p>When I decided to learn how to use Camtasia for creating instructional video lessons, I opted to learn by doing, as it was the best course of action for me. After researching and reading reviews, I chose Camtasia, which appeared easy to use from the demo videos. As I reflect on using the tool, I found it to be very intuitive, allowing me to use all of its features effectively, such as transitions and audio editing. I also learned that recording in short clips and pausing when needed was the most effective process for me.</p>

    <p>The learning theory that supports my approach to learning Camtasia is project-based learning (PBL). According to Krajcik et al. (2014), PBL is an instructional approach that engages learners in solving real-world problems through the completion of authentic projects. By using Camtasia to create instructional videos, I was able to engage in a real-world project that required me to use the tool's features to solve problems and create a product that met my instructional needs. This allowed me to actively construct my understanding of how to use Camtasia and apply my knowledge in a meaningful context.</p>

    <p>Constructivism is another learning theory that supports my approach to learning Camtasia. As noted by Jonassen (1991), constructivism emphasizes the importance of learners constructing their own understanding of concepts and ideas by actively engaging in the learning process. Through the project-based approach, I was able to construct my own understanding of how to use Camtasia by actively engaging with the tool and experimenting with its features to create my instructional videos.</p>

    <p>My biggest "ah-ha" moment about my approach to learning how to use Camtasia effectively was a confirmation of something I already know, I learn best by doing. This is why I was so succesful in the software development boot camp I completed and also why I became such an expert in the subject areas I taught while a math teacher. Instead of relying on traditional lectures or tutorials, I learned by actively engaging with the tool and constructing my understanding of how to use it. This approach was definitely more engaging and motivating than traditional approaches would be, and it allowed me to apply my learning in a real-world context. The "ah-ha" part is that it led me to an idea. If I want to get better at this software development thing and help others in the process, I can create more video lessons of things I have yet to learn or master. Essentially, learn by doing the things I want to learn but are outside of the scope of the boot camp.</p>
