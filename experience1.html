    <h1 class="mt-3 mb-3">My Elementary School Learning Experience</h1>

    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-5">Activity: Practicing Multiplication Tables through Gamification</h2>
    
    <p>One of my most vivid memories of elementary school is the experience of learning multiplication tables in 3rd grade. I recall my third grade teacher having us play a sort of Red light/Green light game by answering times table questions. We were working on our multiplication skills and as children do in third grade, we had to memorize the times tables. Looking back, this learning experience aligns with the learning theory of behaviorism, which emphasizes the role of reinforcement and punishment in shaping behavior. In the game, the reward for answering times table questions correctly was the ability to move up in the game, while the punishment for answering incorrectly was being stuck at the same level. This system of reinforcement and punishment helped motivate me and my classmates to memorize the times tables in order to progress in the game. This experience of learning multiplication tables through the Red light/Green light game can be considered a gamification strategy for learning. Gamification involves using game design elements and mechanics, such as points, badges, levels, and rewards, in non-game contexts to motivate and engage learners. In the Red light/Green light game, the use of rewards, in the form of the ability to move up in the game, and punishment, in the form of being stuck at the same level, served as a motivation for learners to engage in the learning activity. The game was designed to make learning multiplication tables more enjoyable and engaging, which can enhance the learning experience and lead to better learning outcomes. I would say it worked considering I  remember the experience 30 years later.</p>

    <p>The game also incorporated elements of cognitivism, which emphasizes the role of mental processes in the learning process. To successfully answer the times table questions, we had to engage in mental processes such as memory and problem-solving. We actively had to use our mental processes to make sense of the new information we were learning and to store it in our long-term memory.Furthermore, this learning experience also had elements of constructivism, which emphasizes the role of learners in constructing their own understanding of new information. While the times tables themselves are a fixed set of information, the way we learned and applied them in the game was up to us. We were able to construct our own understanding of how to use the times tables in order to progress in the game.</p>
    
    <p>In summary, my experience of learning multiplication tables in 3rd grade was a combination of behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism. The use of reinforcement and punishment in the game aligned with behaviorism, while the mental processes required to successfully answer the times table questions aligned with cognitivism. Additionally, the opportunity to construct our own understanding of how to use the times tables aligned with constructivism. This experience highlights the importance of incorporating different learning theories in order to create effective instructional strategies.</p>
