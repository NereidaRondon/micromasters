    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-5">Activity: Project Based Learning, Software Development Boot Camp</h2>

    <p>After working as a math teacher for 11 years, I decided to learn a new skill b signing up for a software development boot camp. My experience in the boot camp was highly influenced by the principles of andragogy. The learning model used in the course was project-based learning (PBL). This approach allowed me to acquire knowledge and skills in a practical and meaningful context, which I found highly effective in my learning. Additionally, the course's scaffolding of content delivery, from videos to practice assignments, to an all-encompassing final project, supported cognitive load theory and allowed for a manageable and progressive increase in difficulty of tasks.</p>

    <p>The flipped classroom model used in the boot camp is consistent with constructivist learning theory as well. In this model, students learn from videos that are chunked and broken down into manageable pieces, allowing them to construct their knowledge actively. The assignments and coding challenges also encouraged me to reflect on my learning and apply my newly acquired knowledge to solve problems, which is a hallmark of constructivism. Moreover, the mentors in the course played an essential role in providing individualized support and feedback, which is consistent with the belief of constructivism and how learning is a social process. The one-on-one meetings helped me to identify my strengths and weaknesses and receive guidance on how to improve my skills. This personalized approach to learning was highly beneficial to me, given my prior experience as a teacher.</p>

    <p>The use of rubrics in the projects was consistent with behaviorism. The criteria and rubrics provided clear guidelines for grading and allowed me to track my progress and evaluate my work against the learning objectives. Additionally, the coding challenges and practice assignments helped to reinforce my learning and build my skills incrementally, consistent with the principles of behaviorism.  </p>

    <p>Overall, my experience in the software boot camp was a highly effective and efficient way to learn a new skill. Evens so far to say that it put me on the course to change careers. I'm no longer a high school teacher and now I work as a Learning Content Developer for the very same boot camp. I hope to bring my skills to the boot camp's curriculum and imporve on the Adult learning expereince. The learning approach model of PBL, the use of scaffolding and personalized support of constructivism, and the consistency with andragogy practices made it an excellent learning experience for adult learners like me andI hope to take it to the next level. </p>
