    <h1>Behaviorism</h1>

    
    <p>Behaviorism is a theory of learning that emphasizes the role of environmental stimuli in shaping and controlling behavior. The theory proposes that learning is the result of the interaction between an individual's behavior and the environment. It originated in the early 20th century with the work of researchers such as Ivan Pavlov, John Watson, and B.F. Skinner. Pavlov's classical conditioning experiments with dogs showed that a previously neutral stimulus, such as a bell, could become associated with a reflex response, such as salivation. Watson, the founder of behaviorism, believed that psychology should focus only on observable behavior, and that behavior could be shaped through conditioning. Watson built on Pavlov's research and emphasized the importance of conditioning in shaping behavior. Skinner further developed this idea with his theory of operant conditioning by focusing on the role of rewards and punishments in behavior modification (Ormrod, 2016).
      
    However, behaviorism has been criticized for its narrow focus on observable behavior, which has been seen as limiting the understanding of more complex mental processes and internal states. Additionally, some have argued that relying too heavily on external rewards and punishments can create a "crowding out" effect, whereby the desire to engage in an activity for its own sake is replaced by a focus on the rewards or punishments associated with it (Deci et al., 1999). This may result in learners who are less motivated to learn for the sake of learning, and who may struggle with applying their skills and knowledge in real-world situations.</p>
    
    <p>In terms of strengths, behaviorism has been praised for its emphasis on objective, measurable outcomes and its potential for creating effective, efficient, and consistent learning experiences. Behaviorism has also been applied successfully in a variety of settings, from education to corporate training, where it has been used to develop specific job-related skills and behaviors.</p>

    <p>Despite its limitations, behaviorism has had a significant impact on instructional design, particularly in the use of reinforcement to shape behavior and the development of programmed instruction and teaching machines. The use of feedback, a common instructional strategy, has been shown to be effective in developing positive behaviors resulting from instruction (Walinga, 2014).</p>

    <p>Behaviorism has influenced the field of instructional design by highlighting the importance of using reinforcement to shape behavior and emphasizing the need for clear, measurable learning objectives. Behaviorism is deemed applicable to instructional design when you aim to:</p>
  
    <ul>  
      <li>create measurable and observable learning outcomes among students</li>
      <li>use tangible rewards and informative feedback to improve student learning performance</li>
      <li>guide students in mastering a set of predictable skills or behaviors</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>However, its limitations include a narrow focus on observable behavior and the potential for over-reliance on external rewards. Instructional designers must take these factors into account when applying behaviorist principles to create effective and engaging learning experiences. It is my opinion that in K-12 and higher education, grades are a form of behaviorism as they are often used to reinforce certain behaviors and discourage others. I also think that grades are over used and perhaps an antiquated approach when dealing with child learners. </p>

    <p>The use of grades as a form of reinforcement is based on the assumption that students will work harder and perform better when they know that their efforts will be rewarded with a good grade. This is a classic example of positive reinforcement, where a desired behavior is strengthened by adding a positive stimulus, in this case, a good grade.</p>

    <p>Similarly, grades can also be used as a form of punishment to discourage certain behaviors. For example, a student who consistently fails to turn in assignments or attend class may receive a low grade, which is a form of negative reinforcement that aims to discourage that behavior. This can be seen as an example of the principle of operant conditioning, where behaviors are modified by their consequences.</p>

    <p>While grades can be an effective way to motivate students and shape their behavior, they are not without their limitations. The use of external rewards like grades can lead to a lack of intrinsic motivation, where students are not motivated by a genuine interest in the subject matter but rather by the desire to earn a good grade. This can lead to a surface approach to learning, where students focus on memorizing information rather than developing a deep understanding of the material. With my experience in the classroom for the past 11 years, I know it to be true that students often turn in work or complete assignments simply for the grade and not for the learning outcome. Often, students don't learn anything from the assignments they complete because all they want is that grade.</p>

    <p>Overall, while grades can be an effective tool for shaping behavior and motivating students, they should be used in conjunction with other forms of assessment and feedback that focus on promoting intrinsic motivation and a deep understanding of the material. Additionally, instructional designers should be aware of the potential negative effects of grades and strive to create a supportive and collaborative learning environment that promotes student engagement and self-directed learning.</p>
