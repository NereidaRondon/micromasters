    <h1 class="mt-3 mb-3">My High School Learning Experience</h1>

    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-5">Activity: Project Based Learning, Create a First Civilizations Diorama for World History Class</h2>

    <p>One experience that stands out in my high school learning was when I had to make a diorama of a made-up ancient civilization's geography in my world history class. This activity provided a refreshing break from the typical lectures and note-taking, and allowed me to engage with the material in a more hands-on way. From a learning theory perspective, this activity aligns with constructivism, which emphasizes the role of learners in constructing their own understanding of new information. By creating the diorama, I was able to actively engage with the material and build my own mental model of an ancient civilization's geography. Additionally, the activity allowed me to draw on my own experiences and prior knowledge to create a unique and personalized representation of the geography.</p>

    <p>The diorama activity also aligns with cognitive load theory, which emphasizes the importance of managing cognitive load in the learning process. The hands-on nature of the activity provided a way for me to reduce the cognitive load that comes with simply listening to a lecture or reading notes. By engaging with the material in a more visual and interactive way, I was able to better understand and retain the information.</p>

    <p>In terms of learning approach models, this activity aligns with project-based learning (PBL). PBL emphasizes the importance of engaging students in real-world, relevant projects that allow them to apply their knowledge and skills in meaningful ways. By creating the diorama, I was able to apply what I had learned in class to a real-world project that was relevant and interesting to me. This activity provided a valuable learning experience that allowed me to engage with the material in a more meaningful and memorable way. </p>

    <p>In conclusion, the diorama activity in my high school world history class aligns with constructivism, cognitive load theory, and the project-based learning approach model. This experience serves as a reminder of the importance of incorporating hands-on, real-world activities in the learning process to create a more effective and engaging learning experience.</p>
